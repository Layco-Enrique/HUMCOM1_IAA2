    <h2>Five Feet Apart</h2>
    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTGIdFRIPL0ibwxcV0loZRHLjKSgQY-b_OkMmWSNN2NXAVGtQ0f" width="150" height="200" align="left">
        <p>Two teenagers, Stella Grant (Haley Lu Richardson) and Will Newman (Cole Sprouse) both have a genetic disease known as Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Two people with CF must not get closer than six feet to prevent cross-infection. Stella, determined to make it out of the hospital one day, is strict with her medication. Will prefers to slack off and avoid his responsibilities, angering her. Will, who has contracted B. Cepacia, is part of a new drug trial, and does not have a lung transplant for him, while Stella has been on the transplant list for a long time. She later finds out that Will is not doing his treatments, and tries to help him. In return, Will only asks her for permission to draw a picture of her. Over time, they begin doing their treatments together. Will and Stella fall in love, but can't get closer than six feet of each other.</p>
        <p>Stella's G-tube later gets infected and she has to undergo surgery to get it replaced. Stella's sister, Abby, who was normally with Stella during surgery, died from a botched daredevil stunt. This has left Stella with severe survivor's guilt, who now faces surgery alone. Will, having learned about Abby's death, goes to accompany Stella and sings her the song Abby would always sing her before surgery.</p>
        <p>As Will leaves Stella's surgical prep room, he is caught by a nurse named Barb. Barb tells him a story about two people with CF who fell in love with each other; both of whom died from being near each other and cross contracting each other's bacteria. Will does not want to hurt Stella, so he says he can not see her anymore. Stella becomes upset and angry. She later plans an attempt to meet Will. She decides to take back one foot that CF had stolen from her. She carries around a pool stick which measures exactly five feet; keeping her and Will five feet apart at all times.</p>
        <p>On Will's birthday, Stella's best friend Poe, another CF patient, dies. As an act of rebellion to CF, the two decide to leave the hospital to visit the lights that she could see from her hospital room, which Stella has always wanted to do before.</p>
        <p>While away from the hospital, Stella receives a text that her lung transplant is en route, which she promptly ignores. Stella falls through the ice of a frozen pond as she and Will leave to go back to the hospital.</p>
        <p>Will reaches into the water and pulls out a nearly dead Stella. Even though saliva contact is the worst for two people with CF, he gives her CPR to save her life. Stella survives and Will and Stella are brought back to the hospital. Because of the CPR he had given her, Will fears that she has now contracted B. Cepacia. Stella is given her lung transplant which goes all according to plan and, miraculously, she has not contracted B. Cepacia.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Will finds out that the drug trial he has been on has not been working for him. After her transplant, while under anesthesia, her parents, Will's mother, and the nurses and doctors all agree to help Will set up the lights outside of Stella's room.</p>
        <p>After realizing the he will likely infect her after her transplant is complete, Will decides to say a final goodbye to Stella, confessing his love for her. Before he leaves, she is given his sketchbook of drawings he had done of her and her friends during their stay in the hospital.</p>

    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTxZMby8EP8qiYak5_w6Qq_hwujtosncWKiZLNBmRXFNzcx4TJG" width="150" height="200" align="left">
        <p>The Straw Hat Pirates come to Delta Island for the Pirate Fest, a large pirate gathering organized by Buena Festa. Festa sends the pirates to a floating island to hunt for a treasure that belonged to the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. The Straw Hats and many other pirate crews, including those from the Worst Generation as well as other past allies and enemies, set sail on a Knock Up Stream and battle each other as they race toward the treasure. However, this event is secretly set up as part of a plan between Festa and legendary pirate Douglas Bullet, who had been in the great prison Impel Down for two decades until being freed two years ago. Trafalgar Law discovers this and is attacked, but escapes onto the Thousand Sunny and warns the Straw Hats. Robin, Sanji, Chopper and Brook go with him to investigate, followed by the undercover Smoker. After sneaking into Festa's hideout, they discover that he has conspired with the Marines to send a Buster Call on Delta Island, which would destroy it and everyone on it.</p>
        <p>As the treasure is found, a ship arrives and destroys the floating island. The pirates fall into the bay below, where Bullet takes the treasure and challenges the members of the Worst Generation to a fight. Luffy and the other Worst Generation members are quickly overwhelmed by his strength and Clank-Clank Fruit powers. He attempts to kill Luffy, but Usopp distracts him, causing Bullet to attack him instead. Meanwhile, the other pirates attempt to flee from Delta Island, but find the Marine Buster Call fleet headed toward them.</p>
        <p>As the pirates fight the Marines, Law's group encounters Smoker in Festa's lair, and Sanji battles him while Law and Robin escape. Sanji reveals to Smoker that Festa arranged for a Buster Call to arrive; Smoker was unaware and realizes that the Marines were set up. Meanwhile, Law and Robin run into the former Warlord Crocodile, who wants to involve Law in a plan. Bullet confronts the Buster Call fleet and reveals his awakened Devil Fruit powers, destroying the fleet and the town around him and forming it into a gigantic colossus, with which he overwhelms the pirates and Marines. Festa reveals that the treasure in Bullet's possession is an Eternal Pose that can guide ships to Laugh Tale, the location of the most famous treasure One Piece. Bullet's dream is to become Pirate King by defeating the world's strongest people, and Festa intends to use his warpath and treasure to start a new era. After hearing of Bullet's actions, Marine Fleet Admiral Sakazuki orders a second Buster Call to attack the island.</p>
        <p>Sanji, Robin, Chopper, and Brook meet up, and the former two attempt to find a way to escape the island while the latter two look for Luffy. Chopper and Brook find Luffy and Usopp half dead, and Chopper treats them. After regaining consciousness, Luffy sets off to attack Bullet, but is overwhelmed. The Warlord Boa Hancock attempts to find Luffy, and she does so while running into Buggy, Smoker, Law, and Sabo in the process. Law shares his plan to defeat Bullet by tearing apart his colossus, and Crocodile as well as a lurking Rob Lucci join them. Their combined attacks destroy one of its arms, and Luffy destroys the other one with Gear Fourth. Shots fired by Usopp then destroy the rest of the colossus. Luffy and Bullet engage in a fistfight, and Luffy defeats him.</p>
        <p>Crocodile and Lucci attempt to obtain the Eternal Pose, but Luffy destroys it, claiming he will find the One Piece with his crew without help. Festa mourns the failure of his plans, and is defeated and captured by Sabo. Luffy reunites with his crew and they attempt to escape along with the other pirates, but are confronted by the second Buster Call fleet. However, Smoker contacts his superiors to say there is no longer a need for the Buster Call, and Sabo helps the pirates pass through the fleet safely with his abilities.</p>
        <p>In a post-credit scene, it is revealed that Roger disapproved of the Eternal Pose and threw it away, believing that the One Piece could not be obtained by someone who would rely on it. In the present, Luffy's crew is shocked that he destroyed the Eternal Pose, except for Usopp. Luffy claims that if that they had taken it, they would have missed out on many great adventures.</p>
